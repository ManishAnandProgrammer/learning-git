Step 1: Optional - Only for first time users
	git config --global user.name "John Doe"
	git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
	
Step 2: initialize repository
	git init
	
	-> This is going to create a .git folder inside directory
		can be seen by: 
			*  ls -a
		command

Step 3: Git Status
	-> after adding new files in the folder we should check the status
		of our repository.

		git status

		this command will show us the files that need to add, if all 
		files are added already that we can proceed to push it.

Step 4: Git Add files
	-> after checking status of files which need to add in repo,
		we have to follow the command

		----> For Files Seprately <-----
		git add [file Name] [file Name]

		----> If you want to add all files at once <-----

		git add .

	-> By Default "git add ." command is going to add all 
		files from current folder. if we want to add all files from 
		current folder and also from parent folder than we have to use
		below command : 

		git add -A

Step 5: Remove Files From staging
	-> if we mistakely added some files to the repo than we can 
		remove it by

		-----------> For Files Seprately <----------
		git rm --cached [File Name] [File Name]


		-----------> For Remove All Files At Once <----------
		git rm -r --cached .

		---------> Another Way[After First Commit] <------------
		git restore --staged .

Step 6: Git Commit
	-> After adding files to the staging are now we can 
		create a commit of it.

		git commit -m "Your Message About This Commit"



Stpe 7: Git Log

	git log

	-> To see commit in full details
	git show [hash given by git log command]


Stpe 8: Check differnce before adding file to staging
